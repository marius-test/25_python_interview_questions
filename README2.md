# 25_python_interview_questions

**1. What is Python? What are the advantages of using Python?**

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

---

**2. What is a dynamically typed programming language?**

In dynamically typed programming languages, type checking is performed at runtime. This means that variables are checked against types only when the program is executing and that the type of a variable can change over its lifetime.

Examples: `Python, JavaScript, Lisp, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Lua`

**3. What is an interpreted programming language?**

An interpreted language is a programming language where instructions are executed by another program (an interpreter) rather than compiled directly into machine code beforehand.

Examples: `JavaScript, Perl, Python, BASIC`

**4. What is PEP 8 and why is it important?**

Introduced in 2001, PEP 8 is a style guide for Python code that promotes readability and consistency.  
PEP stands for Python Enhancement Proposal â€” a design document providing information to the Python community.

**5. What is Scope in Python?**

Scope defines the visibility and lifetime of variables.  
- Variables created inside a function have local scope and are accessible only within that function.  
- Variables created in the main body have global scope and are accessible throughout the program, including inside functions (unless shadowed).

**6. What are lists, tuples, and sets? What is the key difference between them?**

Lists, tuples, and sets are collections used to store multiple items in a single variable.

- **List**: Ordered, mutable, indexed, allows duplicates.  
- **Tuple**: Ordered, immutable, indexed, allows duplicates.  
- **Set**: Unordered, mutable (you can add/remove items), unindexed, no duplicates allowed.  
  *Note: Set items themselves are immutable.*

**7. What are the common built-in data types in Python?**

Python includes these built-in data types:

- **Text Type**: `str`  
- **Numeric Types**: `int`, `float`, `complex`  
- **Sequence Types**: `list`, `tuple`, `range`  
- **Mapping Type**: `dict`  
- **Set Types**: `set`, `frozenset`  
- **Boolean Type**: `bool`  
- **Binary Types**: `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`  
- **None Type**: `NoneType`

**8. What is `pass` in Python?**

The `pass` statement is a no-operation placeholder used when a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.

- Prevents syntax errors in empty blocks such as loops, function definitions, classes, or conditionals.
- Executes without doing anything.
